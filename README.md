# minesProject2020

- This boiler plate is here to help you start with the 2020 project at Mines Nancy
- So it is recommended to **fork** this repository into your github account
- The data is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/vinayshanbhag/radar-traffic-data): do not add/commit the data into your github repository ! When I will run your code, I will copy in the root directory of your project the uncompressed data file, so you may assume in your code that this file is available.

## Mandatory

- Your github history must start no later than Nov. 23rd
- Your must write your report in **markdown** collaboratively into the file report.md
- Both contributors must commit into the code with your personal github account: you will be individually evaluated based on your individual contributions as shown in the github history, both for the source code and report.
- Before starting to work, you must agree with your collaborator on a common file encoding (I recommend UTF-8), on a common line termination format (I recommend the linux LF), and on whether you're going to use "4 spaces" or "tabulations" in python (I recommend 4 spaces); then you must **configure** your editor or IDE to use these agreed formats ! You must then test that it's working fine by editing, each of you, a single different line in the same python source file, commiting and pulling: then check that in the git history, a single line modification per user is reported.
